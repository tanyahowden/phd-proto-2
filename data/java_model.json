Generally speaking , helps avoid overly fancy visually eects like high contrast font types , keep simple using existing palettes . Heres  tips keep even high-delity mockups grounded simplicity :  Design projects needs  If stakeholders trouble articulating needs expectations , ask collaborate . You start discussion around images , logos , visual hierarchy well mockup done ( dont let nal say , otherwise thats design committee ) . Dont skip wireframing  e wireframe guideline mockup . It allows answer broader questions layout content dont distract visual decisions . Like Priority Guide , wireframe naturally collaborative since concepts easily digestible .  Focus centralized concept  Sketching wireframing great early concepting , need clear direction mockup time . As old Native American adage goes , If chase two rabbits , lose both.  Check rival sites  In general , its helpful habit aware competitors , wireframing mockup phases its especially helpful thinking outside company . A quick heuristic review shows competitors succeed  improve site based mistakes .  Dont neglect mockup presentation  One main functions mockup assistance stakeholder presentation .

Good product managers keep PRDs up-to-date daily weekly basis , view entire PRD process ongoing  document never truly complete , simply evolves team iterates . requirements document recipe rather guideline . Marty Cagan , Partner Silicon Valley Product Group , ex-plains four core sections PRD  defining purpose , describing features , setting release criteria , sketching rough timing  weve adapted purposes . According Cagan , PRDs goal explain What , How . In sec -tion , remember clear problem solved versus solution otherwise may lead team make incorrect assumptions . The engineers , designers , UX folks ones designing solutions product  dont piss making PRD recipe rather guideline . Now lets take look approach section PRD. . Product Requirements Document Make sure discuss user problems ( solutions ) must addressed , target demographic ( companies , cus -tomers , users ) various use cases demographic .

Youll want outline criteria five areas :  Functionality  Is baseline percentage original features must retained ? What absolute man-datory functions ?  Usability  Is program aesthetically striking intuitive users ? What acceptable time complete tasks use case ?  Reliability  Whats maximum acceptable failure rate ? Are failures predictable ? Can system recover failures ?  Performance  How fast must ? What maximum response time , throughput , memory consumption ?  Supportability  Is testable , serviceable , installable , configurable ?
